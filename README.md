# Parsing-with-Design-Patterns
This project employs a combination of design patterns – the Decorator Pattern, Composite Pattern, and Factory Method Pattern – to enhance the modularity, flexibility, and reusability of a SimplifiedHTMLParser program. The Decorator Pattern enables dynamic addition of functionalities to objects without altering their structure. This encourages code reusability and adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle. The Composite Pattern treats individual objects and compositions uniformly, simplifying client code interactions and promoting flexibility by allowing easy addition of new component types. Additionally, the Factory Method Pattern facilitates the creation of FileSaver objects without specifying concrete classes, supporting extensibility for various file formats.

While these patterns introduce complexity by requiring an understanding of class relationships, they ultimately yield improved modularity and maintainability. The project's core functionality involves reading HTML, JS, and CSS content from files, parsing HTML to create a CompositeNode object, and applying decorator objects like CSSDecoratorNode, ClassAttributeDecorator, and HeadElementDecorator to modify the DOM Document. The CompositeNode class represents HTML nodes capable of processing JS and CSS content, with subclasses like DivElement and ParagraphElement for specific elements. DecoratorNode abstract class extends HTMLNode, implementing the Decorator Pattern, and its subclasses enhance the head element, add class attributes, and apply CSS styles. The Factory Method Pattern is employed through FileSaverFactory, promoting loose coupling and facilitating future extensions for different file formats. In essence, this project showcases the power of design patterns in creating a flexible and maintainable HTML parsing and modification tool.
